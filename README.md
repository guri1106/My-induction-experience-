‚ú® # Day 4 ‚Äì #A Day of Learning and Self-Discovery ‚ú®
<br>

The fourth day of our induction program began with an energizing English session by prof. Astik Sharma. We introduced ourselves and explored the importance of communication skills ‚Äî the art of expressing ourselves with clarity and confidence. He also gave us a small but meaningful assignment to practice what we learned.
<br>

Next, we attended a Chemistry lecture by prof. Karan Bhalla, which started with an interactive conversation. He not only explained study-related topics but also guided us on developing the right mindset for academic success.
<br>

After a short break, we gathered in the auditorium for a deeply inspiring session on Universal Human Values by Ms. Priya Darshani. She spoke about how real happiness comes from within ‚Äî through right understanding, right feelings, and a sense of responsibility. We discussed how our emotions often fluctuate between excitement and feeling low, and how continuous happiness comes from inner harmony rather than outside conditions. She also guided us through activities to reflect on our needs ‚Äî both continuous needs of the self (like respect and relationships) and temporary needs of the body (like food and comfort). We learned to classify our aspirations, recognize our natural acceptance for harmony, and think about ways to resolve our concerns by understanding their root causes. Her talk encouraged us to look within ourselves for long-lasting peace and joy.

<br>

The day ended with a fun and engaging interactive session by the Causmic Club, filled with activities that boosted our creativity, teamwork, and confidence.

<br>

Day 4 was not just about learning ‚Äî it was about self-awareness, values, and the journey toward becoming a better human being.
